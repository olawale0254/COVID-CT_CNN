st.subheader("Overview")
st.markdown("<p style='text-align: justify; color: white;'>In the last few years, deep learning has increasingly shown the potential to improve healthcare by aiding medical professionals with diagnostic processes and patient interactions. In particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a class of deep learning algorithms, have successfully been applied to classify images of biological features that are often used to help monitor overall health and detect disorders in patients. As the rate of COVID-19 increases the use of the traditional method of diagnosing becomes too inefficient and time consuming therefore, a computational model that processes a CT scan sample Image and to classify if there exist COVID-19 or not in the image, have significant practical applications in the field of medicine. This project proposed to take a step towards creating this model by using Deep CNNs to build a model that can classify an CT scan image that contains COVID-19 or not. Three models (Xception, VGG-16, GoogleNet) were proposed and will be trained using a dataset of 2492 CT scan images</p>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
